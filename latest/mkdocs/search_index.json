In simple linear regression, we might consider a functional relationship $y = \u03d5(v) = \u03b1v + \u03b2$, with parameters $\u03b1$ and $\u03b2$. However, if the function $\u03d5$ has an arbitrary nonlinar form, it might be hard to come up with suitable basis functions to use for linear regression. This package provides a set of convenient methods to estimate $\u03d5(v)$ as a linear combination of basis functions, such as radial basis functions, for situations where $v$ has a single or multiple dimensions.\n\n\n\n\nBasisFunctionExpansions\n\n\nExpansion types\n\n\nUsage\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting the number of basis functions\n\n\nDynamics modeling\n\n\nLPV ARX modeling\n\n\nLPV State-space modeling\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExpansion types\n\n\n#\n\n\nBasisFunctionExpansions.BasisFunctionApproximation\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nBasisFunctionApproximation(y::Vector, v, bfe::BasisFunctionExpansion, \u03bb = 0)\n\n\n\n\nPerform parameter identification to identify the Function \ny = \u03d5(v)\n, where \n\u03d5\n is a Basis Function Expansion of type \nbfe\n. \n\u03bb\n is an optional regularization parameter (L\u00b2 regularization).\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nBasisFunctionExpansions.UniformRBFE\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nA Uniform RBFE has the same variance for all basis functions\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nBasisFunctionExpansions.MultiUniformRBFE\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nA \nMultiUniformRBFE\n has the same diagonal covariance matrix for all basis functions See also \nMultiDiagonalRBFE\n, which has different covariance matrices for all basis functions\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nBasisFunctionExpansions.MultiDiagonalRBFE\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nA \nMultiDiagonalRBFE\n has different diagonal covariance matrices for all basis functions See also \nMultiUniformRBFE\n, which has the same covariance matrix for all basis functions\n\n\nsource\n\n\n#\n\n\nBasisFunctionExpansions.MultiRBFE\n \n \nType\n.\n\n\nA \nMultiRBFE\n has different diagonal covariance matrices for all basis functions See also \nMultiUniformRBFE\n, which has the same covariance matrix for all basis functions\n\n\nsource\n\n\n\n\nUsage\n\n\nWe demonstrate typical usage with some examples.\n\n\nThe idea is to create an object representing an expansion.

The task is to estimate a function $y = \u03d5(v)$, where $\u03d5$ is a basis function expansion.\n\n\nN = 1000\nv = linspace(0,10,N) # Scheduling signal\ny = randn(N) # Signal to be approximated\ny = filt(ones(500)/500,[1],y)\n\n\n\n\nNext, we setup the basis function expansion object $rbf$ and use it to create a reconstruction object $bfa$\n\n\nNv  = 10 # Number of basis functions\nrbf = UniformRBFE(v,Nv, normalize=true) # Approximate using radial basis functions with constant width\nbfa = BasisFunctionApproximation(y,v,rbf,1) # Create approximation object\ny\u0302   = bfa(v) # Reconstruct signal using approximation object\nscatter(v,y, lab=\nSignal\n)\nscatter!(v,y\u0302, lab=\nReconstruction\n)\n\n\n\n\nFor comparison, we can also plot the regular linear regression $y = \u03b1\u2080 + \u03b1\u2081x + \u03b1\u2082x\u00b2... \u03b1\u2099x\u207f$ for varying orders of $n$.\n\n\nA = v.^(0:3)'\ny\u0302_linreg = [A[:,1:i]*(A[:,1:i]\\y) for i=2:4]\nplot!(v,hcat(y\u0302_linreg...), lab=[\nLinear regression order $i\n for i=1:3]')\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we can see from the figure, the linear combination of basis functions forming the reconstruction has learnt the overall structure of the signal \ny\n. To capture more detail, one can try to increase the number of basis functions. The final choice of this number is a tradeoff between reconstruction bias and variance, where a high number of basis functions can model the signal in great detail, but may generalize poorly to unseen data.\n\n\n\n\nMultiple dimensions\n\n\nWe now demonstrate the same thing but with $v \u2208 \u211c\u00b2$.

In this case, good center locations and covariances are estimated using K-means clustering. With this strategy, we can usually get away with much fewer basis functions compared to a uniform grid.

Consider the following dynamical system, with an non-linearity on the input $A(z)y = B(z)\\sqrt{|u|}$ We can simulate this system using the code\n\n\nA = [1,2*0.7*1,1] # A(z) coeffs\nB = [10,5]        # B(z) coeffs\nu = randn(100)    # Simulate 100 time steps with Gaussian input\ny = filt(B,A,sqrt.(abs.(u)))\n\n\n\n\nWe can now try to fit a regular ARX model to this input-output data\n\n\nyr,A  = getARXregressor(y,u,3,2) # We assume that we know the system order 3,2\nx     = A\\yr                     # Fit using standard least-squares\ne_arx = \u221a(mean((yr - A*x).^2))   # Calculate RMS error (4.2553882233771025)\nplot([yr A*x], lab=[\nSignal\n \nARX prediction\n])\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDue to the non-linearity at the input of the system, the linear model fails to fit the data well. Our next attempt is a non-linear model based on BFEs. We select the simplest form of multi-dimensional BFE, \nMultiUniformRBFE\n and further select to cover the state-space with 2 basis functions along each dimension corresponding to $y$, and 4 basis functions along each dimension corresponding to $u$ for a total of 2^2*4^3=256 parameters (4 basis functions is the smallest number that can accurately fit $\\sqrt{|u|}$). The number of parameters in this case is large compared to the number of data points, we will need some regularization to fit this model properly. The regularization choice is made when forming the \nBasisFunctionApproximation\n and the strength is determined by the last argument \n1e-2\n in this case.\n\n\nbfe   = MultiUniformRBFE(A,[2,2,4,4,4], normalize=true)\nbfa   = BasisFunctionApproximation(yr,A,bfe, 1e-3)\ne_bfe = \u221a(mean((yr - bfa(A)).^2)) # (0.005174261451622258)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe non-linear model fits the data much better!\n\n\nWe also note that if we knew in advance that the system is linear with a non-linearity on the input, we could do this in a lightly more efficient way by incorporating lagged values of $y$ directly in the regressor, instead of expanding the lagged values of $y$ in a BFE.\n\n\n\n\nLPV State-space modeling\n\n\nWe can also estimate a state-space model with varying coefficient matrices, i.e. a model on the form $x(t+1) = A(v)x(t) + B(v)u(t)$\n\n\nThis is accomplished using the built in convenience type\n\n\n```@doc\nLPVSS\n\n\n\n\nExample:\n\n\n```julia\nnc    = 10                                        # Number of centers\nmodel = LPVSS(x, u, nc; normalize=true, \u03bb = 1e-3) # Estimate a model\nxh    = model(x,u)                                # Form prediction\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLearn more\n\n\nFunctionality in this package is used in the packages\n\n\n\n\nRobotlib.jl\n\n\nLPVSpectral.jl\n\n\nDynamicMovementPrimitives.jl\n\n\n\n\nAnd in the papers\n\n\n\n\n[\"Linear Parameter-Varying Spectral Decomposition\"\n\n\n\n\nBagge Carlson, Fredrik; Robertsson, Anders and Johansson, Rolf (2017) American Control Conference Conference](http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/ac32368e-e199-44ff-b76a-36668ac7d595)\n\n\n\n\n[\"Modeling and Identification of Position and Temperature Dependent Friction Phenomena without Temperature Sensing\"\n\n\n\n\nBagge Carlson, Fredrik; Robertsson, Anders and Johansson, Rolf (2015) IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems](http://lup.lub.lu.se/record/7613758)",
